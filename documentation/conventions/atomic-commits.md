# Developer Tip: Keep Your Commits [Atomic](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/)


Source control is a developerâ€™s best friend. The ability to share code
with multiple developers, track changes, and easily roll back when problems
arise is indispensable in this distributed world.

One question that often arises when first getting started with source
control is "What do I check in, and how often do I do it?"
The answer is to make the changes as small and "atomic" as possible.


### Atomic Commits

An "atomic" change revolves around one task or one fix.


### Atomic Approach

- Commit each fix or task as a separate change
- Only commit when a block of work is complete
- Commit each layout change separately
- Joint commit for layout file, code behind file, and additional resources


### Benefits

- Easy to roll back without affecting other changes
- Easy to make other changes on the fly
- Easy to merge features to other branches
