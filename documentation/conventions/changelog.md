# [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)


### What is a changelog?

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered
list of notable changes for each version of a project.


### Why keep a changelog?

To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable
changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.


### Who needs a changelog?

People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software
are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software
changes, people want to know why and how.


### How to make a good changelog?

#### Guiding Principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).


#### Types of changes

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities


### How to reduce the effort required to maintain a changelog?

Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:

- People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
- At release time, you can move the `Unreleased` section changes into a
- new release version section.


### Can changelogs be bad?
